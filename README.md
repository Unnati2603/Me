# Windows XP Portfolio

Remember the good old days of Windows XP? That satisfying sound when you booted up your computer, the iconic bliss wallpaper, and those chunky folder icons? Well, I got a bit nostalgic and decided to build my portfolio as a Windows XP desktop!


This is my personal portfolio website that looks and feels like Windows XP. Double-click on folders to open them, browse through my projects and skills using a file explorer, and enjoy that sweet, sweet nostalgia while learning about me!


- **Desktop with Folders**: Just like the old days - click around and explore!
- **Authentic Folder Icons**: They even change from closed to open when you click them (just like XP!)
- **File Explorer Window**: Browse through my portfolio content like you're using Windows Explorer
- **No Clippy**: I promise, no annoying paper clips will pop up asking if you need help

##  How It Works

I created a custom Folder component that uses the original Windows XP folder icons. When you double-click a folder, it opens the File Explorer to show you the contents. Everything is organized in folders just like you'd expect!

## ðŸš€ Want to Run This Locally?

If you want to run this project on your own computer (maybe you want to see how I built it or just want to click around locally), here's how:

```bash
# Install all the dependencies
npm install

# Fire up the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and enjoy the Windows XP experience!

## ðŸ”§ Tech Behind the Scenes

I built this using:
- **Next.js**: For all the React goodness with server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: To keep my code less buggy
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling everything quickly
- **Custom Icons**: Those authentic Windows XP icons for maximum nostalgia

## ðŸ’¡ Have Ideas or Feedback?

If you have suggestions for how to make this portfolio even more Windows XP-like, or if you found a bug, feel free to reach out! I'm always looking to improve and add more nostalgic features.
